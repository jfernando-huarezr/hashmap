# hashmap
Odin hashmap

HashMap class with the following methods:

1. hash(key): takes a key and produces a hash code with it.
2. set(key, value): takes two arguments, the first is a key and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten. When a collision happens, it adds it to the same bucket (Linked list). Here we also check if we need to increase the number of buckets according to currentKeyPairs > bucketCount * loadFactor. If we need to, the method resize is called. 
3. resize(): increase and refactor all the key-pair elements.
4. get(key): takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.
5. has(key): takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
6. remove(key): takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it return false.
7. length(): returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
8. clear(): removes all entries in the hash map.
9. keys(): returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
10. values(): returns an array containing all the values.
11. entries(): returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]
